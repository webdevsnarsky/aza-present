== Description ==

A light plugin that automatically updates cart page and mini-cart when product quantity is changed. Removes the default "Update cart" button. Optionally turns off cart page notices.

<h4>Features</h4>

* Both mouse and keyboard changes are supported.
* Works for custom dropdown lists with 'qty' class.
* Compatible with plugin [Qty Increment Buttons for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qty-increment-buttons-for-woocommerce/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work correctly on my website? =

Ajax Cart AutoUpdate for WooCommerce is designed to work on any WooCommerce-based website. It's tested for compatibility with version 3.0 (previously 2.6) and newer. It uses the default Ajax update event for the cart page, exactly the same as the "Update cart" button, for 100% compatibility.

= Update delay is set to 0. Why doesn't my cart update instantly? =

This plugin relies on the same event as "Update cart" button and none of them will update instantly. To update the quantity on the backend, a request needs to be sent from the website to the server and then a response back to the website. How fast it happens, is based entirely on the server response time.

= Quantity field on my cart page disappeared. How to fix it?

By default, this plugin changes the minimum quantity in the cart from 0 to 1. If min = max quantity, WooCommerce hides the quantity input field, so all products with max quantity = 1 will have it hidden with this setting checked.

= My cart page notices disappeared, how do I restore them? =

Removing cart page notices is enabled by default in plugin settings. Simply uncheck this option.

= Can I remove only selected cart page notices? =

Currently, it's not possible. Removing cart page notices is only an addition to the core functionality of this plugin, however, if enough users communicate me that such feature is important, I will consider it for future releases.

= Will this plugin affect my page speed? =

Very little, it's a small plugin that executes only on the cart page.
